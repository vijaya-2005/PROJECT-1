                        . It is usually made of leather with a stiff or thick sole and heel, and generally reaches no higher than the ankle.
                         Shoes are designed to cover, protect, and comfort the human feet, 
                        and are also used as decoration and fashion. Footwears protect the feet and give stability to the body.</p>

                    <p >It is very light in weight, that diabetes do not feel any pressure under their feet. The inner portion is so soft with MCP / MCR layer that the feet and heels rest comfortably with proper support.
                    
                        These shoes for diabetic patients provide plenty of room for toes as well allow air to circulate free </p>

                    <p >
                        Some medial arch support is essential to help support the structures within the arch of your foot, such as the plantar fascia and midtarsal joints. When your 
                        shoe is completely flat, it increases stress on these features and can lead to inflammation and degeneration of these structures.</p>

                    <h3 class="sec-div1-h1">Health plus</h3>
                    <p > Foot ulcers are common complication of the diabetic foot. Healing can take a while and it is imperative that pressure is removed from the area and good wound dressings are used.
                    
                        Our shoes for diabetic patients and custom-molded inserts work together as a preventative system to help diabetics avoid foot injuries. </p>
